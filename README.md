# Meta Report Data Creator

[![Project Status: Unsupported â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state but the author(s) have ceased all work on it. A new maintainer may be desired.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/unsupported.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#unsupported)

**This project is archived for future reference, but no new work is expected in this repository. Future work is expected to be based off [`workflow.pacta`](https://github.com/RMI-PACTA/workflow.pacta).**

## Instructions

1. Download the the initiavtive Download package from the CTM platform, and unzip it.
2. Prepare a `config.yml` file, by filling out `template.yml`
3. Prepare the docker image
4. Prepare the SAS
5. `export STORAGE_ACCOUNT_SAS`
6. Run phase 1 script
7. Deploy

```sh
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group "RMI-SP-PACTA-DEV" \
  --template-file azure-deploy.json \
  --parameters azure-deploy.parameters.json
```

### Preparing the Docker image:

1. `az acr login -n transitionmonitordockerregistry`
2. Update `Dockerfile`'s `FROM` line to use the appropriate tag of the `workflow.transition.monitor` docker image (should be a private image, including data).
3. `docker build . -t "transitionmonitordockerregistry.azurecr.io/workflow.meta.report.data.creator:$(date +'%Y%m%dT%H%M')"`
4. `docker push` the image you just built

Take note of the tag generated for use during the deploy step.


### Generating the SAS

Generate an SAS for the storage account. It gets passed to the Azure Deploy Script.
An expiration time of ~ 72 hours should be enough to handle most projects.

### Phase 1

from the directory containing the unzipped initiative package and `config.yml`

**WARNING:** Make sure that the `STORAGE_ACCOUNT_SAS` envvar is available to the Rscript environment. (`export STORAGE_ACCOUNT_SAS="blahblahblah"`)

```bash
Rscript /path/to/script/phase-1_combine-portfolios.R config.yml
```

This takes a few minutes for a reasonable-sized project (a few thousand portfolios).

### Deploy (phase 2)

```sh
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group "RMI-SP-PACTA-DEV" \
  --template-file azure-deploy.json \
  --parameters azure-deploy.parameters.json
```

Answer the questions that `az` provides with the values noted later.

### Phase 3

```bash
Rscript phase-3_combine-results.R
```

combines the results into peer files (meta + org in one set, user_id in the other)
